#### Data-Download

Time Price Volume (TPV) data is hosted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saltwateroil/bitstamp-tpv-usd). It can be downloaded directly or with use of `wget` [link to download](https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/saltwateroil/bitstamp-tpv-usd).

create a folder name `data` and unzip data there with name `bitstamp_tick_data.csv`
![hardware](/screenshots/data-download.png)

#### Compiling-Building

1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/xpd54/backtesting`
2. update submodule `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. create a build folder and build `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`

This generate 3 exicutables

1. ohlc_generator (To convert TPV to binary form of OHLC data formate)
2. trade_simulator (Execute trade simulation)
3. plot (plot graph with evaluation log)

#### Tick-Data-Generation

Any trade simulation we would like to run on different frequency of tick data. `ohlc_generator` does this to do it quickly with **[start_time - end_time)** (time range to consider for ohlc (open high low close))

`cd quick_run && chmod +x quick_ohlc_generation.sh`
`./quick_ohlc_generation.sh` (might take a minute or two as tpv data is close to 3.2gb). I suggest checking `quick_ohlc_generation.sh` before running it, naming convention is self explanatory.

#### Strategy-and-Terms

Rebalancing Trade Strategy :- Basic idea here is to keep the protfolio value (BTC \* BTC price + USD) in a way where crypto currency weight is defined by **alpha** and it's allowed to go up and down by **epsilon**.
Example :-
**alpha** 0.7 means that we would like to keep 70% of the total portfolio value in the base (crypto) currency,
and 30% in the quote currency (USD) for whole execution time. So Current quick run between
**[start_time='2017-01-01' - end_time='2024-01-01']**
we would mentain 70% in BTC and 30% in USD for whole 7 years while looking to make profit.

**epsilon** 0.05f means maximum allowed deviation from the desired alpha-allocation.
We allow the actual base (crypto) currency allocation to be within the interval: **[alpha x (1 - epsilon) - alpha x (1 + epsilon)]**.

So [0.735 - 0.665] which means it's allowed to allocate 73.5% to 66.5% in BTC and rest corresponding in USD.
<small>codebase is self explanatory but will add more clarity in words soon!!</small>

#### How-to-Run

use `quick_run/quick_simulation.sh` to run trade simulation over 5 min frequancy data.
Example commands are [HERE](https://github.com/xpd54/backtesting/tree/main/quick_run)

```bash
./trade_simulator \
--input_price_history_binary_file="../data/bitstamp_tick_data_5min.mov" \ (change it to 30min.mov and 1h.mov for other frequncy)
--output_account_log_file="../data/account.log" \
--output_simulator_log_file="../data/simulator.log" \
--start_time="2017-01-01" \ (start execution from jan 2017 to jan 2024)
--end_time="2024-01-01" \
--start_base_balance=1.0 \ (we have 1 btc to start with)
--start_quote_balance=0.0 \ (we have 0 usd to start with)
```

Here we can see with rebalancing trade strategy we have gain of 2043.60%. But if we would have just buy and hold it's 4272.85%. Well HODL strategy is the best in crypto market do time travel and buy in 2011 and sell in 2024 that's [HODL](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp).

if we run same strategy over diff frequncy it should be close enough (2055% gain) on 1h frequncy with similar 0.49 score.

We should look into our evaluation log which shows we are selling our 0.3 btc immediately we our alpha was set for 0.7 (70% in btc) we achive that balance.

```

If we plot the portfolio value we see it started with 1 BTC and goes down (get sold and alocate in USD) asap after that it trade in range of [0.735 - 0.665] (73.5% to 66.5%) of allocation.
(Number of data point which i am using is limited to 30000 as higher data point plot generation become slower)
![Plot](/screenshots/gnuplot.png)

Let's run it with multiple combination of alpha and epsilon **[alpha|epsilon]**. Again if we look int the score we can see highest score suggest allocating most of assets in BTC which is HODL (buy and hold).

```bash
./trade_simulator \
--input_price_history_binary_file="../data/bitstamp_tick_data_1h.mov" \
--output_account_log_file="../data/account.log" \
--output_simulator_log_file="../data/simulator.log" \
--evaluation_period_months=6 \
--start_time="2017-01-01" \
--end_time="2024-01-01" \
--start_base_balance=1.0 \
--start_quote_balance=0.0 \
--evaluate_combination=1
```

<sub>TODO:- Add more details on how rebalancing trade strategy works</sub>

#### How-To-Add-New-Strategy

By implementation of interface provided into `backtesting/base/trade_simulator/trade_simulator.hpp`
And updating `backtesting/simulators/simulator_factory.hpp` and `backtesting/simulators/strategy/common_strategy_config.hpp`
it's easily can be achived.

#### Performance-Details

I am using [mmap](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html) to read write into file. Which map the disk file directly to memory. I wrote a [common-util](https://github.com/xpd54/common_util) which have easy to use header only lib.

#### Task-And-Improvements

- [x] Single instance Logger for both console and logfile.
- [ ] Use CRTP to avoid using virtual.
- [x] Improve read/write with memory mapped file.
- [x] Write OHLC data to binary file.
- [ ] Run account logging on different process.
- [ ] Rebalancing trade strategy doc.
- [ ] Financial indicators
- [x] Integrate google test
- [ ] Unit Test cases
